# NTUA ECE - Computer Networks Laboratory - 8th Semester

## Overview
This repository contains reports for the Computer Networks Laboratory course at NTUA ECE, 8th semester. The coursework involves setting up and analyzing practical network topologies, exploring LAN interconnections, routing mechanisms, and essential networking protocols.

## Description
The exercises focus on configuring different network architectures to understand key concepts such as:
- LAN interconnection using switching.
- Static and dynamic routing with protocols like RIP, OSPF, and BGP.
- Dynamic IP addressing via DHCP.
- Network security implementations using firewalls and NAT.
- IPv6 protocol specifics, its interaction with IPv4, and DNS functionality.

## Setup
The network topologies are built using VirtualBox with FreeBSD virtual machines, leveraging various networking tools:
- **Free Range Routing (FRR):** Implements dynamic routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).
- **IPFW:** The FreeBSD native firewall, handling firewall rules and NAT configurations.
- **FreeBSD Native Network Stack:** Supports LAN interconnections, VLAN setups, and switching.
- **Additional Tools:** Various utilities to facilitate network simulation and management.
